Before starting the Power BI dashboard development, it's important to address key questions to ensure clear objectives and alignment:

- **Project Objective:** What is the main goal of the Power BI dashboard?
- **Success Metrics:** How will we measure the success of the dashboard?
- **Project Timeline:** When is the project expected to be completed?
- **Stakeholder Previews:** Do stakeholders expect to see a preview or prototype before the final release?
- **Stakeholder Expectations:** What outcomes or benefits do stakeholders anticipate?
- **Stakeholder Concerns:** Are there any concerns stakeholders have about the dashboard's development?
- **User Demographics:** Who will primarily use the dashboard and for what purposes?
